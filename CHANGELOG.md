# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Enum variants are now no longer generated by default.
- The generated enum will have the same visibility as the original struct.
- The generated enum will contain struct variants and retain their field names.
    This should help with creating large update objects.


### Removed
- Support for generics has been temporarily removed until we produce a better
    design
- `skip_default` and `rename_default` attributes have been removed.
